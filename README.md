  @StackedApp(
        dependencies: [
            ...
            LazySingleton(classType: CrashlyticsService),
            ...

        dependencies: [
            ...
            Presolve(
            classType: CrashlyticsService,
            presolveUsing: CrashlyticsService.getInstance,
            ),
          ],
        )
    ```

* Add the log Output inside your logger under outputs inside multiple logger output like so
    ```dart 
    Logger(
    ...
        output: MultipleLoggerOutput([
